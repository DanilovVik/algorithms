/**
 * Difficulty:
 * Medium
 *
 * Desc:
 * Given two strings text1 and text2, return the length of their longest common subsequence.
 * A subsequence of a string is a new string generated from the original string with some characters(can be none) deleted without changing the relative order of the remaining characters. (eg, "ace" is a subsequence of "abcde" while "aec" is not). A common subsequence of two strings is a subsequence that is common to both strings
 * If there is no common subsequence, return 0.
 *
 * Example 1:
 *
 * Input: text1 = "abcde", text2 = "ace"
 * Output: 3
 * Explanation: The longest common subsequence is "ace" and its length is 3.
 *
 * Example 2:
 * Input: text1 = "abc", text2 = "abc"
 * Output: 3
 * Explanation: The longest common subsequence is "abc" and its length is 3.
 *
 * Example 3:
 * Input: text1 = "abc", text2 = "def"
 * Output: 0
 * Explanation: There is no such common subsequence, so the result is 0.
 *
 * Constraints:
 * 1 <= text1.length <= 1000
 * 1 <= text2.length <= 1000
 * The input strings consist of lowercase English characters only.
 *
 * 给定两个字符串 text1 和 text2，返回这两个字符串的最长公共子序列。
 * 一个字符串的 子序列 是指这样一个新的字符串：它是由原字符串在不改变字符的相对顺序的情况下删除某些字符（也可以不删除任何字符）后组成的新字符串。
 * 例如，"ace" 是 "abcde" 的子序列，但 "aec" 不是 "abcde" 的子序列。两个字符串的「公共子序列」是这两个字符串所共同拥有的子序列。
 * 若这两个字符串没有公共子序列，则返回 0
